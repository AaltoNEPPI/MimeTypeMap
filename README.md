MimeTypeMap
===========

Provides a huge dictionary of file extensions to mime types. 

A [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MediaTypeMap) is available for easy integration into VisualStudio and automatic updates.  Alternatively, you can clone and reference or copy the class to your project.
